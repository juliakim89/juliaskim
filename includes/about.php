			<h4>About me</h4>
			<p>I am a thoughtful product designer, quick to learn, and always hands on.</p>
			<p>I am completely self-taught. I learned Photoshop on my own when I was 12 years old because of my curiosity in creating graphical banners on a Korean k-pop forum called Soompi. I also dabbled a little in HTML/CSS because I wanted to create my own templates and themes on Xanga (a journalling platform). I ended up graduating with a B.A. in Architecture at UC Berkeley but I knew my passion had always been in design. </p>
			<p>I learned most of my front-end design skills through picking up freelance web design projects and became an experienced product designer during my time at Tradesy.</p>
