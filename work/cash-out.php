				<h3 class="subheader">Pain points</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Designs were too text heavy for our users who skim</li>
					<li>Low comprehension on "padala" vs "padala express"</li>
					<li>Majority of users needed to tap between multiple screens and dropdowns to find preferred channel</li>
					<li>Users had to scroll through a dropdown of 40+ bank cashout options, when the top 6 banks make up 85% of bank cashouts</li>
					<li>Fees were not specified for loan amount until 4th step</li>
					<li>Low contrast and small font not great for small devices, broken, or scratched screens</li>
					<li>Requirements to pick up loan hidden in heavy small text</li>
					<li>Nearly 50% of tickets were about the status of their loan</li>
					<li>Estimated time frame on when to expect their loan wasn't clear</li>

		<h3 class="subheader">Design Sprint in Manila, Philippines</h3>
		<p>We spent 2 weeks in Manila to fully understand the pain points, talking to customers and working with our in-market team members to ideate and test new designs.</p>

				<p>At the beginning of our trip, we spent an entire day shadowing 6 customers through off-site home visits to better understand the cash out process in real life. We also received 10 diary studies and interviewed 6 of them about their experiences. In market interviews showed that people wanted transparency and convenience.</p>
				<p>We identified 3 opportunity areas to focus on for our design ideations:
					<ol>
						<li>It's not clear what the values are for selecting different channels</li>
						<li>It's not clear what's happening when I'm waiting for my loan</li>
						<li>I'm not given the appropriate information to claim my loan</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>We spent the next 4 days conducting 26 interviews to go through 22 design protypes!</p>
